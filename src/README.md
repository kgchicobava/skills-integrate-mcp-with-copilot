## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

Teacher credentials are loaded from `teachers.json`. The sample account is `teacher` with password `school-admin`.
